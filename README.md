## About

React-Playground is a repo where I'll be messiing around with React with ES6 syntax in order to understand the fundamentals of the library. There is no specific structure to the code since I just want to play with a lot of the features.

## Usage

After cloning the repository, run the following command to install the application's dependencies.
```
$ npm install
```

To run the application
```
$ npm run start
```

## Development

### Process

I use a variety of resources for this sandbox, but most of what I'm learning from is https://egghead.io/courses/react-fundamentals.
